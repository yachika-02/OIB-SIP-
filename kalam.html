    <h2>Why I Admire Him</h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, popularly known as the "Missile Man of India", is one of the most inspiring figures in Indian history. What makes him special to me is his humility, dedication, and visionary leadership despite coming from a modest background. His life proves that no dream is too big if one is committed to learning and working hard.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a renowned aerospace scientist, he played a pivotal role in India's space and missile programs. He later served as the 11th President of India (2002–2007) and was deeply loved for being "The People's President". He remained a teacher at heart until his final day, always encouraging students to dream big and contribute positively to society.
    </p>

    <p>
      I adore how he combined science, spirituality, and education into his life philosophy. His famous books like <em>"Wings of Fire"</em> and <em>"Ignited Minds"</em> are still powerful sources of motivation for students across the world. His life continues to remind us that with passion, perseverance, and purpose, we can achieve the impossible.
